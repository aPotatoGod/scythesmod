Hey this is the first time I make a minecraft mod

I thought scythes were pretty cool, so I added them to minecraft


## FAQ

#### Q: Why Quilt? Why not Forge or Fabric?

**A: Short answer:** I do not wish to continue supporting loaders led by transphobes / racists / horrible people in general, especially when a better product like Quilt exists.

#### Q: But I really wanna play with this mod and I play on Fabric!

**A: You can run Fabric mods on Quilt**. 99% of Fabric mods run perfectly on Quilt, so if you wanna use this mod alongside Fabric ones, consider switching. It's not as big of a task to move as it seems. If you find an incompatibility from a Fabric mod on Quilt, [you can report it here](https://forum.quiltmc.org/t/mod-incompatibility-megathread/261) and the Quilt team will do its best.

#### Q: Can I port this mod to Forge / Fabric?

**A: sure go for it**

#### Q: Can I port this mod to Bedrock?

**A: Yes**

#### Q: Can you backport this mod to 1.x? When will you update to 1.x?

**A: No**. I mod Minecraft as a hobby with very limited time. Therefore, I will not backport this mod to older versions of Minecraft, and I will update it to future versions when I feel like it. If you want it updated to newer versions, feel free to contribute to the mod and make a pull request, it's appreciated! Otherwise, don't come begging.

#### Q: Can I include this mod in a modpack?**

**A: Yes** you can. Go ahead, don't bother asking. Please however provide credit and a link to either the GitHub repository or Modrinth page.
